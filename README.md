# rhythm
Code to process audio data to study speech rhythm

This repository will contain functions to extract the amplitude envelope for speech signals. 
We can use this to get a basic sense for what the rhythm of an utterance is like. 

### Dependencies
python3, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, wavfile (from scipy.io), scipy.signal, playsound, glob, os

### Dataset
We are using excerpts from Switchboard Conversational English (SWB)

### Running code
You can run the code by executing the main routine. It will ask for the folder and file name
```
./main.py
```
